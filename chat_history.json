Most of these people do not know that they are infected. The epidemic has not been overcome anywhere. Virtually every country in the world saw new infections in 1998 and the epidemic is frankly out of control in many places.",

It is a mathematical representation of a computing process that can simulate any mechanical or electronic digital computer.\n\n**Components:**\n\n* **Tape:** An infinitely long tape divided into cells. Each cell can hold either a 0 or 1.\n* **Head:** Reads and writes symbols on the tape.\n* **State register:** Keeps track of the current state of the machine.\n* **Transition function:** Defines the rules for changing the state, writing a symbol, and moving the head based on the current state and the input symbol.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. The machine starts in a specific initial state.\n2. It reads the input symbol from the cell under the head.\n3. Based on the current state and the input symbol, the transition function determines:\n    - The new state to be entered.\n    - The symbol to be written on the tape.\n    - The direction the head should move (left or right).\n4. The process repeats until a final state is reached.\n\n**Formal Definition:**\n\nA Turing machine is a quintuple (Q, \u03a3, \u0393, \u03b4, q0), where:\n\n* Q is the set of states.\n* \u03a3 is the input alphabet.\n* \u0393 is the output alphabet.\n* \u03b4 is the transition function.\n* q0 is the initial state.\n\n**Properties:**\n\n* Turing machines can simulate any mechanical or electronic digital computer.\n* Any algorithm that can be implemented on a computer can be modeled as a Turing machine.\n* Turing machines are the basis for modern theoretical computer science.\n\n**Applications:**\n\n* Proving the existence of algorithms.\n* Formalizing the study of computation.\n* Understanding the limits of computation.\n\n**Significance:**\n\n* Turing machines provide a mathematical framework for understanding the nature of computation.\n* They have been instrumental in the development of computer science and have influenced many aspects of modern technology.",

For many of the participants, adjusting to living in a rural area was as a major challenge in their adjustment. Participants Jenn (Zambia, Doctor of Philosophy), Myra, Ryan, and Stephen shared stories about how they found it difficult to sleep at times due to the lack of street noise. As they hail from larger, metropolitan cities, the quietude of the university town was an adjustment challenge.",
